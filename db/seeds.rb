# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Drysail.create([{id: 1},
#  {id: 2},
#  {id: 3},
#  {id: 4},
#  {id: 5},
#  {id: 6},
#  {id: 7},
#  {id: 8},
#  {id: 9},
#  {id: 10},
#  {id: 11},
